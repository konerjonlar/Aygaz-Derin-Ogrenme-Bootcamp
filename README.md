# Dog Breed Classification Project

This project aims to classify dog breeds using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes images of 120 different dog breeds.

## Libraries and Technologies Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Data Processing

- A DataFrame containing image pixels and labels was created.
- Categorical labels were transformed into numerical values using the Label Encoding technique.
- The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation subsets.
- Image pixels were normalized.

## Model

- A deep learning model was created using TensorFlow.
- The model includes Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout layers.
- The model was compiled, and the training process was initiated.

## Model Training and Results

- The model was trained on training and validation datasets.
- Metrics such as accuracy, loss, validation accuracy, and validation loss were monitored during the training process.
- The results were visualized and interpreted.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

- The hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
- Optimization results were evaluated, and the best set of parameters was selected.
